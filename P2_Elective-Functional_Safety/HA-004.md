Cooling is one of important variables in modern computing.  
Most modern processors require additional cooler installed to utilize their full performance –  
especially high end CPU/GPU’s like intel’s i7/i9 or Nvidia’s GTX 1080 (probably latest RTX 2080, too).  
Delidding became a popular practice among advanced computer enthusiasts  
because of the cost reduction from chip manufacturers on thermal compounds.

In automotive industry, this has not been a big issue yet but is likely will be in the future  
as more and more cars become computerized everyday. Of course, thermal engineers work hard to dissipate heat  
on electronic systems, and it’s unlikely they will get overheated easily.  
However, there is always a rare complex case can happen.

#### BMW Fire
Recently, there has been an issue with BMW vehicles caught fire during a normal driving in Korea.

This became a major news in Korea last couple of months, and Korean DOT even ordered a suspension of driving on  
tens of thousand BMW vehicles that didn’t take safety inspection.

Here are some videos of BMW vehicles caught fire on the road.

There were over 80 reported BMW fires so far this year according to the fire department.  
Majority of them are particular 520d model (diesel). There is still an argument over the root cause of this fire.  
BMW claims the issue is likely with EGR part of diesel model. However, there were fires on multiple BMW vehicles  
that already took safety inspection, 3 and 7 series models, and even a non-diesel, gasoline engine model  
without EGR caught fire, too. Some test performed by experts exhibited exhaust valve  was opening and closing  
at an incorrect temperature, suggesting there could be a software issue as well.  
The exact root cause is under investigation.

#### Road Environment

Let’s assume if similar issue didn’t lead to a fire but led to an overheating of nearby parts including steering ECU.  
This overheating can cause a processor a serious malfunction, may delay the delivery of torque values to the motor.  
Now, this could be an overshoot, but the vehicle was happen to on the road like this.

Of course, these are some extreme cases, but just like in HA-003, it could be more common than you think  
in some countries with a lot of mountains.  

Would lane keeping assistance be able to handle situations like this reliably?
