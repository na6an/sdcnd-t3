# System Integration
### Programming a Real Self-Driving Car

## Setup 
Original repo can be found here:  
https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone  

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

## Run

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator



`cd ~(path-to)/CarND-Capstone/ros`  
Then,  
```
cd ros  
catkin_make  
source devel/setup.sh  
roslaunch launch/styx.launch  
```
## Troubleshoot

```

## Code Structure

Below is a brief overview of the repo structure, along with descriptions of the ROS nodes.  
The code that you will need to modify for the project will be contained entirely within the  
/ros/src/ directory. Within this directory, you will find the following ROS packages:

/ros/src/tl_detector/  
This package contains the traffic light detection node: tl_detector.py.  
This node takes in data from the /image_color, /current_pose, and /base_waypoints topics  
and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the /traffic_waypoint topic.

The /current_pose topic provides the vehicle's current position,  
and /base_waypoints provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following.

You will build both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node.  
Traffic light detection should take place within tl_detector.py,  
whereas traffic light classification should take place within ../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py.


/ros/src/waypoint_updater/
This package contains the waypoint updater node: waypoint_updater.py.  
The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint  
based on traffic light and obstacle detection data.  
This node will subscribe to the /base_waypoints, /current_pose, /obstacle_waypoint,  
and /traffic_waypoint topics, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car  
with target velocities to the /final_waypoints topic.


/ros/src/twist_controller/
Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (dbw) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control.  
This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle: the node dbw_node.py and the file twist_controller.py, along with a pid and lowpass filter that you can use in your implementation. The dbw_node subscribes to the /current_velocity topic along with the /twist_cmd topic to receive target linear and angular velocities. Additionally, this node will subscribe to /vehicle/dbw_enabled, which indicates if the car is under dbw or driver control. This node will publish throttle, brake, and steering commands to the /vehicle/throttle_cmd, /vehicle/brake_cmd, and /vehicle/steering_cmd topics.
